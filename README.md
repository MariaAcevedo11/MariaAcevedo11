## Hi there 👋

I'm María, software engineering sudent who likes Software Development and AI. 
I take my code seriously, myself, not so much. 

Curious, disciplined, and allergic to spaghetti code. 

Currently building frontend apps and AI models, learning by breaking things (then fixing them properly after crying for 3 hours)

Most of my repositories are for my University classes, however the ones that are not (or I really liked) are pinned onto my profile, check them out (scroll a little bit).
